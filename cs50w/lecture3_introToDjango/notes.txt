Creating a Django app
-first step is to install Django using pip 
-pip3 install Django 
-run a command to create project 
-django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME
-manage.py will be used to manage the project 
-settings.py contains important config settings for the application 
-url.py is kind of table of content for the application 

Django allows multiple applications. 
Eg. Big sites like google have google search, google images etc 

To create a Django app 
-python3 manage.py startapp tasks
-this will create an app in your project called tasks 

To install the app created into the project  
-go into settings.py in the project directory  and add app name 

After adding app in settings, work on views of that app
-eg go into hello app, go to views.py views are routes that users see
-to create default view you do that with a function
-if a particular url is visit the views will determine what should happen 

Create urls.py this will tell the app when they should return the views 
the project created has it's own urls.py but you can create for each app added
-in your project folder go to urls.py and add path 
-go into your new app and create your urls.py
-in your urls.py from the app, specify url patterns 

To run the application
From your main project,
-python3 manage.py runserver


some django import I have used before:

from django.urls import path
from . import views
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
import datetime
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include,path


the project created has it's own urls.py but you can create for each app added
